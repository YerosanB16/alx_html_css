# CSS Advanced Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on advanced CSS styling techniques using the HTML structure from the previous `html_advanced` project. The goal is to convert a raw HTML page into a fully styled, responsive webpage based on a Figma design.

> No external libraries or frameworks are used — only raw HTML and CSS.
